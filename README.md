# Norad

Master-control for my personal Immutant MCP.

## Usage

Put this into `etc/sqs.clj`:

```clojure
{:aws-id "A..........."
 :aws-secret-key "...................."}
```

```
$ lein immutant deploy
$ lein immutant run
```

Norad will then attempt to consume messages from
[SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and send them to your notifier
(presumably screamy).

Messages should be a string that looks like:

```clojure
"{:queue \"queue.notifications\" :msg \"this is a message\"}"
```

Heavy a work in progress.
